The data we collect may include unique advertising identifiers (such as Google Advertising ID and IDFA), unique device identifiers, and anonymized IP addresses. Additionally, we may store data in our own databases, which is used for social features such as leaderboards, tournaments, user ratings, user comments, or to store game progress in the cloud. Some of the data we store in our databases, such as the Gamer ID (Android), is not passed on to our partners.

Our analytics partners include Unity Analytics (https://unity.com/solutions/analytics) and Google Analytics (https://www.google.com/analytics), each of which has their own privacy policy.

<h3>Advertising Information</h3>
Our game displays ads to provide free content. Upon launching the game, certain information is automatically sent to our advertising partners, which may include the app name, device type, and advertising ID. Our advertising partners, such as UnityAds (https://unity3d.com/unity/features/ads), may personalize ads to provide more relevant content to users. Each partner has their own privacy policy.
